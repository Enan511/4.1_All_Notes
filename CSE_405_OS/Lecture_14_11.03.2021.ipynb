    "Deadlock is just as the name suggest. Process uses computer resources. Now process 1 is using resource 1 and process 2 is using resource 2. Now p1 needs r2 untill it gets r2 it won't release r1 on the other hand p2 needs r1 until it gets r1 it won't release r2. So this situation is called a deadlock. It can happen between two or more processes.\n",

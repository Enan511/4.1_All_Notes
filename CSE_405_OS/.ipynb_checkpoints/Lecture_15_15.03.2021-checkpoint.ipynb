Need refers to how much instance may be needed in the future except the current allocation, so need is max-allocation.\n",

    "Here are 5 processes(p0-p4) and 3 types of resources(A-C) each resourse having some number of resource. From the table we can see that p0 using only 1 B type resource, p1 using 2 A type resources, p2 using 3 A type & 2 C type resources and so on. Max represents the life time resource need for each type for each process like p0 will neeed 7 A type, 5 B type, 3 C type resources in its lifetime. Available represents the availabe number of instances of each type after allocation like in total there are 7 instances of A type allocated to 5 processes combindely so for A type there only remains 3 instances.\n",

    "Initially we take two arrays one is work = available array then finish array = number of processes and all index set to False. Now we iterate from i=0;i<5;i++ as there are 5 process so process[i]. For each iteration we check if need is <= work meaning that each index of need should be <= each index of work & finish[i]=False or not.  So for i = 0 finish[i] is false but need[i] is larger than work. So p0 can't be in safe sequence.\n",
    "Now for process 1 finish[i] is false and need[1] is less than work so p1 enters safe sequence. Now as process1 enters safe sequence so work must be updated. now work = work+allocation[i]=work+allocation[1]=work+allocation of process 1 = 3 3 2 + 2 0 0 = 5 3 2 and then set false[i]=true. Next check for i=2. For process 2 need isn't<= work cause first index isn't <=work thus process2 can't get into safe sequence. After iteration done p0 and p2 can't get in so we again start iteration for these two processes. Now p0 need is <=work so p0 enters safety sequence and p2 also enters. Now we have achieved a safe state where no deadlock will occur.\n",

    "We discussed page to frame mapping and fragmentation problem in previous lecture. That problem is called extrernal fragmentation. Ths problem can't occur in page it occurs in frame. But when a page is partially filled then internal fragmentation occurs in  page. In paging we divide the allocated virtual memory into multiple equal pages. So now when a process comes let it will get 1st 3 pages 2 process will get next 3 pages so these;s no scope for external fragmentation. Now we know each page has some address in it so let assume the 1st process fully usses 1st two page and partially uses the last page thus leaving some unused addresses. This wastage problem is called internal storage.\n",

There's no mention of personal computer or not so if someone copies some data from their own personal computer that may fall under this offence. And if I collect dta with permission that shouldnt be an offence but by this it may be offence. This maybe a linguistic problem of translation otherwise these terms are very trevial to be considered as a offence. **So consider the correction of this clause as collecting or copying data from other person's computer, computer system or computer network without their permission.**\n",

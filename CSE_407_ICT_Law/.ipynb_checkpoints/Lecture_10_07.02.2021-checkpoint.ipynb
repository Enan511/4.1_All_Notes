    "GI means geographical indication. Using GI a country/city can claim copy or production rights. Example: for business purpose only Bangladesh can produce&sell Jamdani Sharee as Bangladesh claimed GI for it. Bangladesh also claimed GI for moslin sharee, Hilsha fish etc. If any countr wants to produce these stuff they have use different names for these like they can use the name heritage sharee instead of jamdani sharee. So this is also a part of intelectual property right. GI, trademark, copy right etc falls under intelectual property right."
